## Exploring how gun deaths vary by race
### Question 2
```{r}
gun_deaths %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = race)) + 
  geom_bar()
youth <- gun_deaths %>% 
  filter(age <= 65)
```

### Inline code
We have data about `r nrow(gun_deaths)` individuals killed by guns.
Only `r nrow(gun_deaths) - nrow(youth)` are older than 65.
