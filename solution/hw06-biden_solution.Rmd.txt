```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE)
```

## Load necessary libraries

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(modelr)
library(broom)

set.seed(1234)
theme_set(theme_minimal())
```

## Import data

```{r biden}
biden <- read_csv("data/biden.csv")
str(biden)
```

## Single variable model

```{r biden-gender, dependson="biden-split"}
biden_gender <- lm(biden ~ female, data = biden)
tidy(biden_gender)
```

```{r biden-gender-pred, dependson="biden-gender"}
biden %>%
  as_tibble %>%
  data_grid(female) %>%
  add_predictions(biden_gender) %>%
  mutate(female = factor(female, labels = c("Male", "Female"))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(female, pred, group = 1)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Linear relationship between gender and Joe Biden warmth",
       x = NULL,
       y = "Predicted feeling thermometer")
```

There appears to be a substantial relationship between gender and feelings towards Joe Biden.

## Distribution of residuals

```{r biden-gender-resid, dependson="biden-gender"}
biden %>%
  as_tibble %>%
  add_residuals(biden_gender) %>%
  mutate(pid = factor(pid, levels = 0:2,
                      labels = c("Democrat", "Independent", "Republican"))) %>%
  na.omit(pid) %>%
  ggplot(aes(resid, color = pid)) +
  geom_freqpoly()
```

It doesn't seem terrible. Could maybe do better.

## Separate models for each party type

```{r biden-gender-pid, dependson="biden-gender"}
pid_models <- biden %>%
  as_tibble %>%
  mutate(pid = factor(pid, levels = 0:2,
                      labels = c("Democrat", "Independent", "Republican"))) %>%
  na.omit(pid) %>%
  group_by(pid) %>%
  nest() %>%
  mutate(model = map(data, ~ lm(biden ~ female, data = .)),
         coef = map(model, tidy))

# compare results
pid_models %>%
  unnest(coef) %>%
  ggplot(aes(term, estimate, color = pid,
             ymin = estimate - 1.96 * std.error,
             ymax = estimate + 1.96 * std.error)) +
  geom_errorbar(position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Comparison of separate models by PID for Biden warmth",
       x = NULL,
       y = "Parameter estimate")
```

Overall, Democratic men have higher warmth feelings towards Biden than independents or Republicans. For Democrats, gender does not appear to have a significant relationship with Biden attitudes - Democratic women are not more likely to have higher Biden thermometer ratings than Democratic men. For independents and Republicans, there appears to be a slight effect for gender.
